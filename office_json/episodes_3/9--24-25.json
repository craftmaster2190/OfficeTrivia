As the office prepares for Dwight and Angela's wedding, they also prepare for a panel regarding the documentary at a local theater. Underwhelming attendance to the event leads to disappointment until they realize the people haven't all been let in yet and are waiting outside. The panel reveals the identity of Erin's birth parents, and Pam reveals she is working on something big to pay Jim back for his DVD shown in A.A.R.M.. That night, Jim and Pam throw bachelor and bachelorette parties for Dwight and Angela, respectively. Jim takes Dwight and the guys to a pub where Dwight is oblivious to the waitress being a stripper. Pam and the girls are at a small house, where Jake Palmer returns as the stripper the girls hired for Angela. Everyone except Meredith thinks this is inappropriate considering Jake's mother is present, and Angela does not want a stripper anyway. Phyllis inadvertently causes Angela to be kidnapped by Mose Schrute when she tells Angela that a noise is only the wind. Dwight then must search for Angela, as it is revealed this is another absurd Schrute tradition. The search ends at Kevin's bar, where Dwight and Kevin make amends."

I can't believe you came!\" to which Michael replies, \"That's what she said\". In the bridal chamber, it is decided Phyllis will carry Angela down the aisle due to Angela's leg pain from having been in a car trunk for several hours. The two are married (standing in their own graves, as is Schrute tradition \"as a reminder that this is the only escape from what they are about to do\"), and everyone heads to the reception. At the reception, Jim and Pam dance and kiss, and Jim states that Pam no longer owes him anything. Michael and Pam talk, and she reveals he has kids (and takes so many pictures of them he needs two phones). Michael does one final talking head from his table, saying that he feels like all his kids grew up and married each other, which is \"every parent's dream\". Ryan and Kelly run away together, passing Ryan's son to Ravi who then gives the baby to Kevin. Ravi tells him to report an abandoned baby to child services, but Nellie instead takes the child as her own and tells the camera that if Ryan wants his baby back he can find them \"somewhere in Europe.\""

                        "text": "\"Finale\" was written by series developer and showrunner Greg Daniels, making it his second writing credit for the year, after the season debut \"New Guys\", and his 12th writing credit overall. Rainn Wilson later joked that Daniels was \"the country vet who birthed this puppy\" and had come \"back to put it down\". The episode was directed by Ken Kwapis. Kwapis had originally directed the series' pilot episode. His last directorial credit for the series, prior to \"Finale\", however, was the fifth season episode \"Company Picnic\". \"I figured the character would go back and visit everybody, but he wouldn't do it on camera at this point. I think he had grown past the idea of being in the documentary, that was my take on it. That [Michael Scott] had said goodbye to that aspect of his life, that that's not what was important to him. I just thought, yeah he'd go back and visit, but he wouldn't want the camera crew to be documenting it.\" —Steve Carell, explaining his hesitation to return to The Office. The series finale will guest star Rachael Harris, Dakota Johnson, Joan Cusack, Ed Begley, Jr., Malcolm Barret. The episode will feature the return of several of the series' actors and actresses, including former series writers and stars B. J. Novak and Mindy Kaling, as well as Andy Buckley, Bobby Rae Shafer, Michael Schur, and Matt L. Jones. Early during production for the season, Kinsey and Wilson also noted that the cast and crew were hoping for a return of former lead actor Steve Carell as Michael Scott. In mid-December, Krasinski later revealed that he was optimistic about a return; in an interview with E! Online Krasinski said that the producers were supposedly \"still trying to figure out [Carell's] schedule\" and that the finale \"just wouldn't be the same without him\". However, NBC chairman Robert Greenblatt later admitted during an interview that while he is \"hopeful\", he does not think Carell will return; he noted that Carell was satisfied with his character's exit and did not want to tarnish it. On January 16, Daniels revealed that Carell would not appear in the finale in any capacity, a decision that Carell later reiterated. Three months later, however, the producers for The Office mounted \"an 11th hour effort last month\" to get Carell to make a cameo in the show's final episode, according to TVLine. According to the article, \"while no one is confirming that the final diplomatic push proved successful, no one is denying it either.\" Carell's personal representative confirmed that Carell was on the set for the final episode, but that he did not film any scenes. However, an anonymous source close to the show cryptically said \"don't rule anything out\". TVLine later reported on May 6, that Carell would appear in a cameo, although NBC declined to comment and Carell's representatives continued to deny the reports."

                        "text": "The initial idea for the finale was thought of by Daniels during production of the third season, described as \"a reunion show, in the fashion of the post-competition cast rehashes familiar from reality shows like Survivor\". Daniels, at one point, approached Jeff Probst, the host of Survivor, to appear in the finale as a moderator for the fictional reunion, although he declined. The initial table read for the episode took place on March 4, 2013. Filming commenced on March 6. According to Jenna Fischer, the episode took nine days to film, with the cast devoting 12 hours a day to the episode. The finale was described as \"ambitious\", featuring multiple location shoots, including one in an AT&T Office Building, which stood in for the Scranton Cultural Center. Filming for the episode and series as a whole came to an end on March 16, 2013. Wilson later tweeted a picture of the \"empty\" set after all filming had been finished. Originally, the episode was supposed to be the 23rd and 24th episodes of the season, which would have meant that the series aired exactly 200 episodes. However, the series' penultimate episode was elongated into 2 separate episodes, resulting in \"Finale\" being the 24th and 25th episodes of the season. This meant that the last part of \"Finale\" will be the series' 201st episode. Once filming finished, Daniels in an interview with TVLine expressed his hope to expand the episode, stating, \"I was very excited with the footage we got [...] It's very big. I’m going to beg NBC to super-size it or extend it.\" Daniels later commented that when the editors cut together the first act, it was 23 minutes long; this is much longer than a normal first act for an hour long episode of television. In response, OfficeTally—the largest fan site for the series—started an online petition to supersize the finale, similar to the petition to expand the second season finale, \"Casino Night\". By May 2, the petition had received over 20,000 signatures. On May 7, it was announced that NBC had extended the episode by 15 minutes, meaning that the episode would be 55 minutes in total."

        "The premise of the episode is that the documentary crew has returned to film bonus footage for the DVD release of the documentary. As the office prepares for Dwight and Angela's wedding, they also prepare for a panel regarding the documentary at a local theater. Underwhelming attendance to the event leads to disappointment until they realize the people haven't all been let in yet and are waiting outside. The panel reveals the identity of Erin's birth parents, and Pam reveals she is working on something big to pay Jim back for his DVD shown in A.A.R.M.. That night, Jim and Pam throw bachelor and bachelorette parties for Dwight and Angela, respectively. Jim takes Dwight and the guys to a pub where Dwight is oblivious to the waitress being a stripper. Pam and the girls are at a small house, where Jake Palmer returns as the stripper the girls hired for Angela. Everyone except Meredith thinks this is inappropriate considering Jake's mother is present, and Angela does not want a stripper anyway. Phyllis inadvertently causes Angela to be kidnapped by Mose Schrute when she tells Angela that a noise is only the wind. Dwight then must search for Angela, as it is revealed this is another absurd Schrute tradition. The search ends at Kevin's bar, where Dwight and Kevin make amends.",
        "The following day is the wedding. Jim pulls one final prank on Dwight: he insists that he cannot be his best man, as Dwight is older than Jim. When Dwight tries to change his mind, Jim directs his attention to Michael Scott, standing in the doorway. An excited Dwight exclaims, \"Michael! I can't believe you came!\" to which Michael replies, \"That's what she said\". In the bridal chamber, it is decided Phyllis will carry Angela down the aisle due to Angela's leg pain from having been in a car trunk for several hours. The two are married (standing in their own graves, as is Schrute tradition \"as a reminder that this is the only escape from what they are about to do\"), and everyone heads to the reception. At the reception, Jim and Pam dance and kiss, and Jim states that Pam no longer owes him anything. Michael and Pam talk, and she reveals he has kids (and takes so many pictures of them he needs two phones). Michael does one final talking head from his table, saying that he feels like all his kids grew up and married each other, which is \"every parent's dream\". Ryan and Kelly run away together, passing Ryan's son to Ravi who then gives the baby to Kevin. Ravi tells him to report an abandoned baby to child services, but Nellie instead takes the child as her own and tells the camera that if Ryan wants his baby back he can find them \"somewhere in Europe.\"",
        "Jim and Pam head home and are surprised to find Carol, Michael's former Realtor/ex-girlfriend, showing their house. Pam reveals she has been showing the house for two months, so that if they got an offer, Jim would have no reason not to rejoin Athlead. The couple being shown the house decide they want to buy it, and Jim and Pam agree to sell.",
        "That night there is a DVD release party at the warehouse. Pam reveals her mural, a painting of the office and everyone who works in it. After a group picture, everyone heads up to the office to hang out. Creed is revealed to be living in one of the office's supply closets. Seeing that Erin is busy, Pam takes one final call as the receptionist, which coincidentally is for Jim Halpert. She replies, \"I'm sorry, Jim Halpert doesn't work here anymore.\" Soon after they announce their plans to leave to Dwight, who fires them so that they can both receive large severance packages. Creed sings a song while they tell the cameras about how the documentary has affected them. As everyone leaves the office, Pam takes her painting of the office building from the wall. A flashback shows the moment Michael first put it up."
